RSA-Factoring-Challenge

Welcome to the RSA-Factoring-Challenge repository! This GitHub repository hosts two Python scripts related to RSA factorization, created as part of an ALX challenge. These scripts are designed to provide an educational experience with RSA factorization.

## Scripts

1. **Factorization Script A**

    - **Script Name:** `factors`
    - **Description:** This script reads a file containing integers and factors each integer into a product of two smaller numbers.

2. **Factorization Script B**

    - **Script Name:** `rsa`
    - **Description:** This script reads a file containing a single integer and factors it into two prime factors. It provides a hands-on experience with understanding how composite numbers can be expressed as products of prime numbers.
.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tam-dcreator/RSA-Factoring-Challenge.git
   cd RSA-Factoring-Challenge
2. Run the desired script as an executable, passing a file containing the integer to be factored into prime numbers or a list of integers that you want reduced to a product of two smaller numbers.

## Error Handling

Each script includes error handling to ensure graceful handling of common issues, such as invalid input or file-related errors.
For other unexpected errors, you will receive a generic error message.
